# Covid-Modelling
The paper here is intended to stimulate discussion about the architecture of programs for modelling and tracking Covid-19.

These programs are already very important, and will be more  important for society in supporting economic and social recovery from the pandemic. Now is the time to get their architectures right; if we can do that, they will work better, with huge benefits for society.

The architectural proposals are illustrated by a small Open Source modelling framework, which you can download and run.

Please read the paper; compare it with your own ideas and the modelling frameworks you know; and articulate your own ideas.
